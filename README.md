# Hi Ticketmaster!

This is the code created from having done your assessment.

- Gulp (for running tasks - CSS/JS compiling, Handlebars template running & watchers)
- Handlebars (for templating & allowing for dynamic data handling, as well as data formatting)
- jQuery (for triggering the template code on load of page & AJAX calls to Flickr API)
- SCSS (for styling the pages)
- Normalize (for ensuring consistency between browsers)
